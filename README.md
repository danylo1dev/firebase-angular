## Firebase & AngularFire In Depth 
This repository is a firebase to angular integration project

# Installation pre-requisites

IMPORTANT: Please use Node 16 LST (Long Term Support version).

# Installing the Angular CLI

With the following command the angular-cli will be installed globally in your machine:

# How To install this repository

We can install the master branch using the following commands:

    git clone https://github.com/angular-university/firebase-course.git

    cd firebase-course
    npm ci

Note: **We recommend using npm ci, instead of npm install**. This will ensure that you use the exact dependency versions set on package-lock.json, unlike npm install which might potentially change those versions.

To run the frontend part of our code, we will use the Angular CLI:

    npm start
